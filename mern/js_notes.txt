How to start a react app
- npx create-react-app  => in the folder i am working on
- Do not name the react file the same name as the folder
- the naming is lowercase and separated by - or _
- Going forward we will always use developer tools => right click and inspect then console. Always have this open!

After starting react this are the two files we care about are:
- App.js and packages.json
